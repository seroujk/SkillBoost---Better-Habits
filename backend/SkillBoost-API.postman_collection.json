Speaker 1: Let's talk about those amazing wins. Sleeping 7+ hours nightly for three weeks straight? That's the foundation everything else builds on. Your body and mind are thanking you. Speaker 2: And we love how you've tackled work stress with breathing exercises and boundaries. That shows real self-awareness and growth. It's not about avoiding challenges, but learning how to navigate them skillfully. Speaker 1: Your focus habits for this next phase are spot-on: morning workouts, daily meditation, and a solid evening routine. These aren't just habits, Sarah - they're investments in your future self. Speaker 2: Remember, you've learned something powerful about yourself: you thrive with structure and small wins. Use that knowledge! Each morning workout is a victory, each meditation session is progress. Speaker 1: Sarah, you're not just building habits - you're building a life that aligns with your values. Keep going, stay consistent, and trust the process. We're cheering you on! Speaker 2: This is Skill Boost, and we believe in you, Sarah.
